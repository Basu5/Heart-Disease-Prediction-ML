# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses a structured dataset to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. It focuses on building a predictive machine learning model that can classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on key medical features such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and other cardiovascular-related indicators.
  
   The goal of this project is to support early diagnosis of heart disease using data-driven insights, which can be valuable in healthcare settings for preliminary screening.


# Key Highlights:
Dataset:
Two files were used — values.csv containing 13 health-related features and labels.csv containing the target class 

-> 0 = No Heart Disease.

-> 1 = Heart Disease.


# Jupyter Notebook:

The notebook Heart_decies.ipynb walks through:
i. Data exploration & preprocessing.

ii. Handling imbalanced data.

iii.  Model training using:

  -> Logistic Regression.
  
  -> Naive Bayes.
  
  -> SVM(Support Vector Machine).
  
  -> Decision Tree.
  
  -> Random Forest.
  
iv. Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.


# Objective:
Predict the presence of heart disease to demonstrate how machine learning can support healthcare diagnostics.


# Outcome:
The models trained in this project can classify patients into two classes:

0 — No signs of heart disease.

1 — Likely presence of heart disease.

By evaluating different classifiers, the project identifies which model performs best on the given dataset and could be considered for further clinical validation or deployment in decision-support tools.
